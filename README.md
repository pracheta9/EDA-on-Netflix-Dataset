# EDA-on-Netflix-Dataset

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Netflix’s movie and TV show dataset, aiming to uncover key insights about content trends, popular genres, country-wise distributions, and actor prominence on the platform. The dataset includes attributes such as title, type (Movie or TV Show), cast, country, release year, date added, and listed genres. Initial data cleaning involved standardizing column values and handling missing data by replacing them with “Unknown” to maintain consistency across visualizations. The analysis primarily focused on understanding how Netflix’s content library has evolved over the years and identifying key contributors in terms of countries, genres, and actors.

Overall, the EDA provides a strong foundational understanding of how Netflix’s global content offering is shaped. It highlights how a few key countries dominate content production, how actor representation varies by region, and how genre and format trends have shifted over time. These insights can inform further analysis on user preferences, regional market strategies, or content recommendation systems. The entire analysis was done using simple and intuitive Python visualizations, making the findings accessible even to beginners in data science.


### Problem Statement
With the rapid global expansion of streaming platforms, understanding content distribution, audience preferences, and production trends has become essential for competitive success. Netflix, as a leading OTT provider, offers a vast library of movies and TV shows across various genres and countries. However, this extensive catalog lacks structured insights regarding the most active countries in content production, popular genres, top recurring actors, and temporal release trends.
The problem this project addresses is: "How can we analyze and visualize Netflix's content data to uncover key trends in content type, genre, country contributions, and actor prominence, in order to better understand the platform's global content strategy?".

### Business Objective:
1.Which countries dominate Netflix’s content library.

2.The most common genres and how they vary across regions.

3.Top 10 Rating of content available on Netflix.

4.The most frequent actors featured on the platform.

5.Top Directors dominating the entertainment industry worldwide.

6.Trends in content releases over time (movies vs TV shows)
